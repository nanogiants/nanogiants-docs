## 1. Frameworks

### **NestJS:**

[NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and follows the modular architecture pattern.

## 2. Architecture

### **Monolithic Architecture:**

- **Definition:** A monolithic architecture is a unified model for designing software where all the components of the application are interconnected and interdependent. It usually includes the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer in a single application.
- **Layers:**

  - Presentation Layer (Controllers)
  - Business Logic Layer (Services)
  - Data Access Layer (Repositories)
  - Database

- **Diagram:**

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A[Presentation Layer]
  A --> B[Business Logic Layer]
  B --> C[Data Access Layer]
  C --> D[Database]
  ```

- **Advantages:**
  - Simplicity in development and deployment.
  - Easier to manage and maintain in the initial stages.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Scalability issues as the application grows.

### **Microservice Architecture:**

- **Definition:** A microservice architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is self-contained and focuses on a single business capability.
- **Components:**

  - Multiple Microservices
  - API Gateway
  - Service Registry

- **Diagram:**

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A[API Gateway]
  A --> B1[Microservice 1]
  A --> B2[Microservice 2]
  A --> B3[Microservice 3]

  subgraph Service Registry
      SR[Service Registry]
  end

  B1 --> SR
  B2 --> SR
  B3 --> SR

  subgraph Microservice 1
      B1[Presentation Layer]
      B1 --> C1[Business Logic Layer]
      C1 --> D1[Data Access Layer]
      D1 --> E1[Database]
  end

  subgraph Microservice 2
      B2[Presentation Layer]
      B2 --> C2[Business Logic Layer]
      C2 --> D2[Data Access Layer]
      D2 --> E2[Database]
  end

  subgraph Microservice 3
      B3[Presentation Layer]
      B3 --> C3[Business Logic Layer]
      C3 --> D3[Data Access Layer]
      D3 --> E3[Database]
  end
  ```

  - **Explanation:**

    - **API Gateway:**

      - Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
      - It can also handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc.

    - **Service Registry:**
      - **Role:** Manages the registration and discovery of microservices.
      - **Functionality:** Keeps track of all available microservices and their instances.

- **Advantages:**
  - Improved scalability and flexibility.
  - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Increased complexity in management.
  - Requires a robust infrastructure for inter-service communication and fault tolerance.

## 3. Design Principles of a REST API

When designing a REST API, itâ€™s essential to follow certain principles to ensure that the API is robust, scalable, and easy to use. These principles provide a framework for building APIs that are consistent, intuitive, and maintainable.

### 1. **Resource-Based URLs**

- **Principle:** Use nouns to represent resources in URLs.
- **Example:** `/users`, `/orders`, `/products`
- **Explanation:** Each URL should represent a specific resource, and actions on resources are determined by the HTTP methods used.
- **Recommendation:** Use plural nouns to represent resources (e.g., `/users` instead of `/user`). This convention helps to keep the URL structure consistent and intuitive. However, if there is a strong and well-reasoned justification for using singular nouns, exceptions can be made. The key is to maintain clarity and consistency within the project.

### 2. **HTTP Methods**

- **Principle:** Use appropriate HTTP methods for actions.
  - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
  - **POST:** Create a new resource on the server.
  - **PUT:** Update an existing resource on the server (replaces the entire resource).
  - **PATCH:** Update an existing resource on the server (modifies specific fields).
  - **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **Explanation:** Using standard HTTP methods makes the API more intuitive and predictable.

### 3. **Statelessness**

- **Principle:** Each request from a client should contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.
- **Explanation:** The server should not store any state about the client session. This makes the API scalable and easier to maintain.

### 4. **Consistent and Meaningful Responses**

- **Principle:** Ensure that API responses are consistent and provide meaningful information.
  - **HTTP Status Codes:** Use appropriate status codes to indicate the result of the request.
    - **200 OK:** Successful GET, PUT, DELETE request.
    - **201 Created:** Successful POST request.
    - **204 No Content:** Successful request that does not return any content.
    - **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request parameters.
    - **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication required or failed.
    - **403 Forbidden:** Client authenticated but not authorized.
    - **404 Not Found:** Resource not found.
    - **500 Internal Server Error:** Server encountered an error.
    - ...
  - **Error Messages:** Provide clear and meaningful error messages. We recommend referring to the [RFC7807 Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) for generating meaningful error messages, but this is optional and not a strict convention.
  - **Data Format:** Use a consistent format for data, typically JSON.
- **Explanation:** Clear and consistent responses help clients handle different scenarios effectively. Using a standard like RFC7807 can enhance the clarity and utility of error messages but is not mandatory.

### 5. **Versioning**

- **Principle:** Use versioning to manage changes in the API without disrupting existing clients.
- **Approaches:**
  - **URI Versioning:** Include the version in the URL (e.g., `/v1/user`).
  - **Header Versioning:** Use custom headers to specify the version (e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`).
- **Explanation:** Versioning ensures backward compatibility and allows for continuous improvement of the API.
- **Recommendation:** We do not prefer one approach over the other as long as it follows either URI or Header versioning principles.

### 6. **Pagination, Filtering and Sorting**

- **Principle:** Provide mechanisms to handle large sets of data.
  - **Pagination:** Split large data sets into pages (e.g., `GET /user?page=2&limit=50`).
  - **Filtering:** Allow clients to filter results based on criteria (e.g., `GET /user?role=admin`).
  - **Sorting:** Allow sorting of results (e.g., `GET /user?sort=name&order=asc`).
- **Explanation:** These features improve performance and provide flexibility to clients.

### 7. **Security**

- **Principle:** Ensure the API is secure to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Authentication:** Verify the identity of users (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
  - **Authorization:** Control access to resources (e.g., roles and permissions).
  - **Data Encryption:** Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
  - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Explanation:** Security is critical to protect both the API and its users.

### (Optional) 8. **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**

- **Principle:** Include hyperlinks in responses to guide clients on possible actions.
- **Example:** A response for a user resource might include links to related resources like user orders.
- **Explanation:** HATEOAS enhances discoverability and navigability of the API.

By following these design principles, you can create REST APIs that are robust, scalable, and easy to use, meeting the needs of both developers and users.

## 4. Documentation Guidelines

Documentation is a critical aspect of backend development, ensuring that developers can understand and work with the code effectively.

### API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is essential for understanding and interacting with the API.

1. **API Specification**

   - **Principle:** Define the API using the standard specification of OpenAPI/Swagger.
   - **Explanation:** This helps in generating interactive API documentation and client libraries.

2. **Usage Examples**

   - **Principle:** Include examples of requests and responses for each endpoint.
   - **Explanation:** Examples make it easier for developers to understand how to interact with the API.

3. **Error Codes**

   - **Principle:** Document possible error codes and their meanings.
   - **Explanation:** Clear error documentation helps developers debug and handle errors appropriately. If you rely on the [RFC7807 Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807), you can skip documenting error codes manually, as the standard provides a structured way to convey error information.

   #### Example of Defining an Error Code (if not using a standard):

   ```json
   {
     "error_code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
     "message": "The specified user does not exist.",
     "details": {
       "user_id": "12345"
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example:

   - **error_code:** A unique identifier for the error.
   - **message:** A human-readable description of the error.
   - **details:** Additional information to help diagnose the issue.

4. **Authentication Details**
   - **Principle:** Explain how to authenticate and authorize requests.
   - **Explanation:** Clear authentication instructions ensure that developers can securely access the API.

### Backend Documentation

In addition to API documentation, comprehensive backend documentation covers various aspects of the backend development process.

1. **Architecture Overview**

   - **Principle:** Provide an overview of the backend architecture, including high-level components and their interactions.
   - **Explanation:** Understanding the architecture helps developers navigate the codebase and make informed design decisions.

2. **Database Schema**

   - **Principle:** Document the structure of the database, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.
   - **Explanation:** Database schema documentation assists developers in understanding data models and query requirements. We recommend displaying database schemas as Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for better visualization. For working with the database in general, we recommend using [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/). DBeaver allows you to easily generate ERDs and manage your database effectively.

3. **Configuration**

   - **Principle:** Document configuration settings for the backend, including environment variables, database connections, and external service endpoints.
   - **Explanation:** Clear configuration documentation facilitates deployment and troubleshooting in different environments.

4. **Deployment Instructions**

   - **Principle:** Provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the backend application, including setting up servers, installing dependencies, and configuring environments.
   - **Explanation:** Deployment instructions ensure smooth and consistent deployment processes across development, staging, and production environments.

5. **Development Guidelines**

   - **Principle:** Outline guidelines and best practices for backend development, covering coding standards, directory structure, version control practices, and code review processes.
   - **Explanation:** Development guidelines promote consistency, collaboration, and maintainability in the codebase.

6. **API Versioning Strategy**

   - **Principle:** Define a strategy for versioning the API to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.
   - **Explanation:** API versioning strategy documentation helps developers understand how to introduce and manage API changes effectively.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**

   - **Principle:** Document monitoring and logging practices, including metrics to track, logging formats, and tools used for monitoring and analysis.
   - **Explanation:** Monitoring and logging documentation aids in identifying and troubleshooting issues in the production environment.

8. **Security Practices**
   - **Principle:** Describe security measures implemented in the backend, such as encryption protocols, authentication mechanisms, input validation, and access control policies.
   - **Explanation:** Security practices documentation ensures that sensitive data is protected and compliance requirements are met.

Backend documentations provide crucial insights into the backend system's design, implementation, and maintenance. While they are typically part of the arc42 documentation, they can also be stored within the project's GitHub repository or another appropriate location.

## 5. Testing Guidelines

Testing ensures the reliability and correctness of the API. It is crucial for maintaining the quality and stability of the API as it evolves.

### Unit Testing:

- **Principle:** Test individual components of the API to ensure they work as expected.
- **Explanation:** Unit tests help catch bugs early in the development process.
- **Scope:** Individual functions or methods.
- **Tools:** [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) (with [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)).
- **What to Test:**

  - Correctness of individual functions.
  - Edge cases and error handling.

- **Recommendation:** Follow the [FIRST principles](https://medium.com/@tasdikrahman/f-i-r-s-t-principles-of-testing-1a497acda8d6) for unit tests:

  - **Fast:** Tests should run quickly.
  - **Isolated:** Tests should not depend on other tests or external systems.
  - **Repeatable:** Tests should produce the same results every time.
  - **Self-Validating:** Tests should have a clear pass/fail outcome.
  - **Timely:** Write tests at the right time, ideally before the code they test.

- **What NOT to Test:**
  - **Dependencies:** Do not test external dependencies directly. This includes:
    - **External APIs:** Avoid making real HTTP requests to external services. Instead, mock these calls to return predefined responses.
    - **Databases:** Do not perform actual database operations. Use mock databases or in-memory databases to simulate interactions.
    - **File Systems:** Avoid reading from or writing to the actual file system. Mock file system operations as needed.
  - **Frameworks and Libraries:** Do not test the functionality of third-party libraries or frameworks. Assume they work as documented.
  - **Configurations:** Avoid testing configuration settings or environment variables directly in unit tests. These should be handled by integration or system tests.

Mocking dependencies helps achieve isolated tests, ensuring that unit tests focus solely on the logic of the component being tested and not on the behavior of external systems.

#### Example of a Good Test:

A good test is fast, isolated, and validates the correctness of a function in various scenarios, including edge cases.

```javascript
// Example of a good unit test in Jest

import { calculateTotal } from './orderService.js';

describe('calculateTotal', () => {
  it('should return the correct total for a list of items', () => {
    const items = [
      { price: 10, quantity: 2 },
      { price: 5, quantity: 1 },
    ];
    const result = calculateTotal(items);
    expect(result).toBe(25); // 10*2 + 5*1 = 25
  });

  it('should return 0 if no items are provided', () => {
    const items = [];
    const result = calculateTotal(items);
    expect(result).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should handle items with zero quantity', () => {
    const items = [{ price: 10, quantity: 0 }];
    const result = calculateTotal(items);
    expect(result).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

#### Example of a Bad Test:

A bad test is slow, not isolated, and tests external dependencies directly, making it unreliable and harder to maintain.

```javascript
// Example of a bad unit test in Jest

import { fetchUserProfile } from './userService.js';
import axios from 'axios';

describe('fetchUserProfile', () => {
  it('should return user profile data from an external API', async () => {
    const userId = 1;
    const response = await fetchUserProfile(userId);
    expect(response).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('id', userId);
  });

  it('should handle non-existent user gracefully', async () => {
    const userId = 999; // Assume this user does not exist in the external API
    const response = await fetchUserProfile(userId);
    expect(response).toEqual({ error: 'User not found' });
  });
});
```

**Problems with the Bad Test:**

- **Slow:** It makes actual HTTP requests to an external API, making it slow.
- **Not Isolated:** It depends on the external API's state, making it unreliable.
- **Hard to Maintain:** Changes in the external API can break the test.

**Improved Version with Mocking:**

```javascript
// Improved unit test with mocked dependency

import { fetchUserProfile } from './userService.js';
import axios from 'axios';
jest.mock('axios');

describe('fetchUserProfile', () => {
  it('should return user profile data from an external API', async () => {
    const userId = 1;
    const mockResponse = { data: { id: userId, name: 'John Doe' } };
    axios.get.mockResolvedValue(mockResponse);

    const response = await fetchUserProfile(userId);
    expect(response).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('id', userId);
    expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('name', 'John Doe');
  });

  it('should handle non-existent user gracefully', async () => {
    const userId = 999;
    axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { error: 'User not found' } });

    const response = await fetchUserProfile(userId);
    expect(response).toEqual({ error: 'User not found' });
  });
});
```

In the improved version, `axios` is mocked to return predefined responses, making the test isolated, fast, and reliable.

### (Optional) Integration Testing:

- **Principle:** Test interactions between components and with external systems.
- **Explanation:** Integration tests ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **Scope:** Interactions between multiple components or services.
- **Tools:** [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) (with [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) and [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)).
- **What to Test:**
  - API endpoints and their responses.
  - Database interactions.
  - Service communication.

### Best Practices:

- **Clear and Isolated Tests:**

  - Write tests that are clear, concise, and isolated.
  - Follow the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern for readability and structure.
  - Use mocks and stubs judiciously to isolate dependencies.

- **Coverage and Prioritization:**

  - Aim for a minimum test coverage of 80% to ensure adequate code validation.
  - Prioritize meaningful tests over achieving high coverage metrics alone.

- **Automation and Integration:**

  - Automate tests to execute on every commit using CI/CD pipelines.
  - Ensure tests are fast-running (Fast), independent of external factors (Isolated), repeatable in any environment (Repeatable), self-validating without manual intervention (Self-Validating), and written in a timely manner (Timely) to maximize their effectiveness. ([See: FIRST principles](https://medium.com/@tasdikrahman/f-i-r-s-t-principles-of-testing-1a497acda8d6))

- **Exclusions and Considerations:**
  - Define exclusions for test coverage, such as test utilities (e.g., factories), and avoid testing aspects like test code itself or aspects difficult to unit test effectively.
