## 2. Architecture

### **Monolithic Architecture:**

- **Definition:** A monolithic architecture is a unified model for designing software where all the components of the application are interconnected and interdependent. It usually includes the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer in a single application.
- **Layers:**

  - Presentation Layer (Controllers)
  - Business Logic Layer (Services)
  - Data Access Layer (Repositories)
  - Database

- **Diagram:**

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A[Presentation Layer]
  A --> B[Business Logic Layer]
  B --> C[Data Access Layer]
  C --> D[Database]
  ```

- **Advantages:**
  - Simplicity in development and deployment.
  - Easier to manage and maintain in the initial stages.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Scalability issues as the application grows.

### **Microservice Architecture:**

- **Definition:** A microservice architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is self-contained and focuses on a single business capability.
- **Components:**

  - Multiple Microservices
  - API Gateway
  - Service Registry

- **Diagram:**

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A[API Gateway]
  A --> B1[Microservice 1]
  A --> B2[Microservice 2]
  A --> B3[Microservice 3]

  subgraph Service Registry
      SR[Service Registry]
  end

  B1 --> SR
  B2 --> SR
  B3 --> SR

  subgraph Microservice 1
      B1[Presentation Layer]
      B1 --> C1[Business Logic Layer]
      C1 --> D1[Data Access Layer]
      D1 --> E1[Database]
  end

  subgraph Microservice 2
      B2[Presentation Layer]
      B2 --> C2[Business Logic Layer]
      C2 --> D2[Data Access Layer]
      D2 --> E2[Database]
  end

  subgraph Microservice 3
      B3[Presentation Layer]
      B3 --> C3[Business Logic Layer]
      C3 --> D3[Data Access Layer]
      D3 --> E3[Database]
  end
  ```

  - **Explanation:**

    - **API Gateway:**

      - Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
      - It can also handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc.

    - **Service Registry:**
      - **Role:** Manages the registration and discovery of microservices.
      - **Functionality:** Keeps track of all available microservices and their instances.

- **Advantages:**
  - Improved scalability and flexibility.
  - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Increased complexity in management.
  - Requires a robust infrastructure for inter-service communication and fault tolerance.

## 3. Design Principles of a REST API

When designing a REST API, itâ€™s essential to follow certain principles to ensure that the API is robust, scalable, and easy to use. These principles provide a framework for building APIs that are consistent, intuitive, and maintainable.

### 1. **Resource-Based URLs**

- **Principle:** Use nouns to represent resources in URLs.
- **Example:** `/user`, `/order`, `/product`
- **Explanation:** Each URL should represent a specific resource, and actions on resources are determined by the HTTP methods used.

### 2. **HTTP Methods**

- **Principle:** Use appropriate HTTP methods for actions.
  - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
  - **POST:** Create a new resource on the server.
  - **PUT:** Update an existing resource on the server (replaces the entire resource).
  - **PATCH:** Update an existing resource on the server (modifies specific fields).
  - **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **Explanation:** Using standard HTTP methods makes the API more intuitive and predictable.

### 3. **Statelessness**

- **Principle:** Each request from a client should contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.
- **Explanation:** The server should not store any state about the client session. This makes the API scalable and easier to maintain.

### 4. **Consistent and Meaningful Responses**

- **Principle:** Ensure that API responses are consistent and provide meaningful information.
  - **HTTP Status Codes:** Use appropriate status codes to indicate the result of the request.
    - **200 OK:** Successful GET, PUT, DELETE request.
    - **201 Created:** Successful POST request.
    - **204 No Content:** Successful request that does not return any content.
    - **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request parameters.
    - **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication required or failed.
    - **403 Forbidden:** Client authenticated but not authorized.
    - **404 Not Found:** Resource not found.
    - **500 Internal Server Error:** Server encountered an error.
    - ...
  - **Error Messages:** Provide clear and meaningful error messages.
  - **Data Format:** Use a consistent format for data, typically JSON.
- **Explanation:** Clear and consistent responses help clients handle different scenarios effectively.

### 5. **Versioning**

- **Principle:** Use versioning to manage changes in the API without disrupting existing clients.
- **Approaches:**
  - **URI Versioning:** Include the version in the URL (e.g., `/v1/user`).
  - **Header Versioning:** Use custom headers to specify the version (e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`).
- **Explanation:** Versioning ensures backward compatibility and allows for continuous improvement of the API.

### 6. **Pagination, Filtering and Sorting**

- **Principle:** Provide mechanisms to handle large sets of data.
  - **Pagination:** Split large data sets into pages (e.g., `GET /user?page=2&limit=50`).
  - **Filtering:** Allow clients to filter results based on criteria (e.g., `GET /user?role=admin`).
  - **Sorting:** Allow sorting of results (e.g., `GET /user?sort=name&order=asc`).
- **Explanation:** These features improve performance and provide flexibility to clients.

### 7. **Security**

- **Principle:** Ensure the API is secure to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Authentication:** Verify the identity of users (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
  - **Authorization:** Control access to resources (e.g., roles and permissions).
  - **Data Encryption:** Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
  - **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Explanation:** Security is critical to protect both the API and its users.

### (Optional) 8. **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**

- **Principle:** Include hyperlinks in responses to guide clients on possible actions.
- **Example:** A response for a user resource might include links to related resources like user orders.
- **Explanation:** HATEOAS enhances discoverability and navigability of the API.

By following these design principles, you can create REST APIs that are robust, scalable, and easy to use, meeting the needs of both developers and users.
