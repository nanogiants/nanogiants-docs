## What is a tech stack?
A tech stack is the set of technologies required to build, maintain, and deploy a software project. When we consider an organisational scope, we must consider all projects (including legacy ones ) to describe the tech stack.

## How do we visualize our tech stack?
We use a tool called [Tech Radar] (https://techradar.nanogiants.de). This is a compact yet flexible overview of a tech stack. It consists of segments that categorise technologies (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, DevOps, infrastructure, ...) and rings that describe the phase in which we place the technology. The phases we use are described as follows:

- Adopt: This technology is well established in our company and we use it for our daily work.
- Trial: We plan to move this technology into the adopt phase and want to learn more about it. Therefore, we are actively integrating it into ongoing projects.
- Assess: This technology seems interesting and we want to understand it better. Therefore, we are testing it (preferably in a side project).
- Watch: This technology seems interesting, but is not yet ready to be evaluated. We will put it on a watch list instead.
- Hold: We have stopped this technology and do not recommend it for use.

The categories we use are listed as follows:

- Client Web Technology
- Client Mobile Technology
- Backend Technology
- Data 
- Infrastructure
- Services
